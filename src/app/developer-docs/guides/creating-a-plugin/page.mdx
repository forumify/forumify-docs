# Creating A Plugin

Plugins are re-usable packages that add functionality to a forumify instance. A plugin should be installable on any forumify instance.
If you'd prefer to create specific functionality only for your forumify instance, you should work in your instance's `src/` folder instead.

## Setup

<Alert severity="info">
    It is recommended to create a local sandbox forumify environment where you can activate your in-dev plugins without causing any issues.
    See the <Link href="/developer-docs/guides/customization/introduction">Customization Introduction Guide</Link> to learn about running a local forumify instance.
</Alert>

forumify plugins are almost identical to Symfony bundles but with some configuration taken care of in an abstraction layer. Let's start by creating an empty directory to work in.

```
$ mkdir todo-plugin; cd todo-plugin
```

Then we'll initialize composer.

```
$ composer init

This command will guide you through creating your composer.json config.

Package name (<vendor>/<name>) [xxx/xxx]: acme/forumify-todo-plugin
Description []: Simple TODO example
Author [n to skip]: n
Minimum Stability []:
Package Type (e.g. library, project, metapackage, composer-plugin) []: forumify-plugin
License []: OSL-3.0

Define your dependencies.

Would you like to define your dependencies (require) interactively [yes]? n
Would you like to define your dev dependencies (require-dev) interactively [yes]? n
Add PSR-4 autoload mapping? Maps namespace "Acme\ForumifyTodoPlugin" to the entered relative path. [src/, n to skip]:


{
    "name": "acme/forumify-todo-plugin",
    "description": "Simple TODO example",
    "type": "forumify-plugin",
    "license": "OSL-3.0",
    "autoload": {
        "psr-4": {
            "Acme\\ForumifyTodoPlugin\\": "src/"
        }
    },
    "require": {}
}

Do you confirm generation [yes]? yes
