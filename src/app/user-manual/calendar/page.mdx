# Calendar

The calendar component brings basic event scheduling capabilities to your forumify.

## Managing calendars

To get started with this component, you first need to create one or more calendars in the <Link href="/user-manual/admin-panel">Admin Panel</Link>.
You can find them under <Wrench /> Settings -> <Calendar /> Calendar.

Calendars can be compared to buckets for events. Each calendar has its name, color, and permissions.

## Managing events

Events are managed entirely from the frontend.

### Creating events

When you have the "Manage Events" permission on at least 1 calendar,
the <span className="btn-link"><Plus /> Create Event</span> button will appear.

### Managing events

Find the event you'd like to modify in the calendar and open it. 
If you have the "Manage Events" permission you will be able to see the edit and delete icons in the top right of the event popup.
