# Security

Security is one of the most important parts of any system. Almost all forumify components have security built into them.

forumify has 2 different ways of securing components, pages, entities,...

- Access Control Lists: defined by entities, controls individual fine-grained access for each "action" per role and per item.
- Role Permissions: defined statically by the platform or plugins, controls access to larger sections or entire components.

## Roles

Everyone visiting your website is given a role. Even users who are not logged in will have the "Guest" role.

Users can have multiple roles. All permissions and ACLs from all the roles the user have are merged together to define what the user can or cannot do.

### Managing roles

You can manage roles in the <Link href="/user-manual/admin-panel">Admin Panel</Link>.
You can find them under <Wrench /> Settings -> <LockKey /> Roles.

<Alert severity="warning">
    Security is a complicated topic. It's best practice to have a second account you can use to test and verify the setup of your roles before assigning any
    real users to them. A misconfiguration of roles could lead to accidentally leaking sensitive data, griefing, or even a total loss of control over your website.
</Alert>

When creating a role, you can give it a title, and it is highly recommended to give them a description.

Optionally, you can enable the "Administrator" checkbox. Enabling this setting will grant access to the admin panel for all users with this role.
This checkbox does not grant the user permissions to do anything within the admin panel, the different components are still protected by permissions.

On the role form, in the tab "Permissions", you can assign permissions to the role. The platform, and each plugin that defines permissions, are separated by tabs.
These permissions are typically meant to (dis)allow access to entire components. For example, if you want to give access to the admin panel to a certain role,
but only to manage badges, you only select "view" and "manage" under "Settings" -> "Badges".

Finally, to add or remove roles from a user, you have to edit the user. You can then manage their roles using the Roles input.

<Alert severity="info">
    Roles use a simple 1 dimensional hiearchy. Meaning that you can only assign roles that are equal-or-below your own role. Roles can be sorted using the
    arrows in front of the rows in the Roles table.
</Alert>


### System roles

There are 3 roles within forumify that can not be deleted or modified:

- **Super Admin**: The Super Admin role bypasses any and all security checks.
It's the most powerful role in your system and should be treated with extreme care.
Only the website's owner should have this role. It is given to the user who installed the platform.
- **User**: The User role is automatically assigned to every user that is logged in.
- **Guest**: The Guest role is automatically assigned to every user that is *not* logged in.

So if you want to grant access to **all** users, all you have to do is assign the permission to both *User* and *Guest* roles.

## ACL (Access Control Lists)

The most common security mechanism you will see in action is ACL. ACL allows you to enable an action for each role.

ACLs are not managed in the Role's setting, but they are managed in the entity that defines them. 
Usually when you see a <LockSimple /> button, you are editing the Access Control List for that entity.
Entities that are governed by ACLs define their own permissions.
For example, a forum defines the permissions "view", "create topic", "create comment",...
