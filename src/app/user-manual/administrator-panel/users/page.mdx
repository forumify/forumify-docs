# Users management

Users page contains the username, the display name and the email adress of all the users of the forum. You can filter the list using the empty boxes at the top.

Clicking the pencil at the right, you can edit any user. Every box is pretty self explanatory. Clicking in the roles & badges boxes, it will open a list.
