## Forums

### General

A forum is where users can create topics. You can create a forum inside a group or alone (see image above). You can change the order using the arrows, the order you see is the order displayed on your forum. The üîí opens the permissions manager.

To edit a forum, you have to click it. There you can edit the **name, type, content and group**.

**Type** "Forum" does not allow images on topics, like a traditional forum. Type "Image Board" requires all topics to have an initial image, like 4chan. Type "Mixed" allows images on topics, but it is not required, like Reddit. The type of a forum can be changed later, however, going from "Forum" to "Image Board" will set your forum's logo on all topics.

**Content** is the description of the forum (see image above).

**Group** is used to move the forum into another group.
