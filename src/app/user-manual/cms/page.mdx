# Content Management System

The Content Management System, or CMS, is a powerful component that allows you to add custom pages and content to your website.

CMS consists of 3 sub-components. Pages, snippets and resources.

## Pages

Pages 

## Snippets


## Resources

While you could link to any resource, or upload your own assets to your website, the resource system makes it easy for your site admins
to find and replace static assets.

Resources could be anything, images, downloads,...

### Managing resources

Resources can be uploaded from the admin panel, they can be found under <Wrench /> Settings -> <Paperclip /> Resources.

Simply supply a name and the file and press save. After saving your resource, it will be given a slug.
Take note of it, **this is what you will need to use the resource** in pages and snippets.

### Using resources

Resources can be used in pages and snippets using the `resource('resource-slug')` twig function

<Alert severityy="info">
    Currently it is only possible to use resources in Twig/Html pages and snippets. Rich text editor does not support them.
</Alert>

### Examples

For the following examples, we've created a resource named "My Cool Resource". The slug that was generated for it is "my-cool-resource".

#### Displaying an image

To display a resource as an image, use the `<img>` tag, with the resource in the `src` attribute.

```twig
<img src="{{ resource('my-cool-resource') }}">
```

#### Dowloading a file

To make the client download a resource, you can use an `<a>` tag, with the resource in the `href` attribute and setting the `download` attribute.

This example shows a download button.

```twig
<a class="btn-primary" href="{{ resource('my-cool-resource') }}" download>
    <i class="ph ph-download-simple"></i>
    Download
</a>
```
