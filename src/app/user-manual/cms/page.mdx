# Content Management System

The Content Management System, or CMS, is a powerful component that allows you to add custom pages and content to your website.

CMS consists of 3 sub-components. Pages, snippets and resources.

<Alert severity="warning">
    The content management system is still in its infancy.
    Although it is already an extremely flexible and powerful component, utilizing it to its full potential requires some basic web development skills.

## Pages

TBA

## Snippets

Snippets are small pieces of content that can be re-used, or more easily modified compared to entire pages.
It's generally a good idea to turn static content into manage-able snippets.

### Managing snippets

Snippets can be managed from the admin panel. Found under <Wrench /> Settings -> <FileCode /> Snippets.

Currently there are 2 types of snippets.
- **Rich Text**: Use a WYSIWYG rich text editor to enter content.
- **Twig**: For raw Twig HTML code, requires some web development skill.

After saving a snippet, it will be given a slug. This slug is what you will need to use your snippet in pages or other snippets.

### Using snippets

You can use your snippets anywhere in Twig code, including CMS pages, or even nested in other snippets.

To use a snippet, use the `snippet('snippet-slug')` Twig function.

For example, if you created a snippet with the name "My Cool Snippet", the generated slug would be "my-cool-snippet".
Then to use your snippet in a page:

```twig
{% extends '@Forumify/frontend/page.html.twig' %}
{% block body %}
    {{ snippet('my-cool-snippet') }}
{% endblock %}
```

## Resources

While you could link to any resource, or upload your own assets to your website, the resource system makes it easy for your site admins
to find and replace static assets.

Resources could be anything, images, downloads,...

### Managing resources

Resources can be uploaded from the admin panel, they can be found under <Wrench /> Settings -> <Paperclip /> Resources.

Simply supply a name and the file and press save. After saving your resource, it will be given a slug.
Take note of it, this is what you will need to use the resource in pages and snippets.

### Using resources

Resources can be used in pages and snippets using the `resource('resource-slug')` Twig function

#### Examples

For the following examples, we've created a resource named "My Cool Resource". The slug that was generated for it is "my-cool-resource".

##### Displaying an image

To display a resource as an image, use the `<img>` tag, with the resource in the `src` attribute.

```twig
<img src="{{ resource('my-cool-resource') }}">
```

##### Dowloading a file

To make the client download a resource, you can use an `<a>` tag, with the resource in the `href` attribute and setting the `download` attribute.

This example shows a download button.

```twig
<a class="btn-primary" href="{{ resource('my-cool-resource') }}" download>
    <i class="ph ph-download-simple"></i>
    Download
</a>
```
