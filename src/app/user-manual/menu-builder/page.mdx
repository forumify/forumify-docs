# Menu Builder

The menu builder allows admins to configure the main frontend navigation for their users.

## Managing the menu

The menu builder can be access from the <Link href="/user-manual/admin-panel">Admin Panel</Link>. Under <Wrench /> Settings -> <List /> Menu Builder.

Use the <span className="btn-link"><Plus /> Add Item</span> button to create a new item in your website's menu.
Enter a label and select a type, then press "Save".

### Menu item types

forumify as well as plugins provide different types of entries for the menu.

- **Collection**: Collections are just groups of menu items. You can nest collections as deep as you want.
- **Url**: The URL type is the most basic menu item type. Ideally this should only be used for external URLs, to link to other websites.
- **Route**: Routes are what forumify uses internally to link to different pages. Routes should be used for any internal links.
When forumify updates, it's possible that the link that is generated behind a route changes, using routes would make sure your item continues to work as expected.
- **Page**: Provides an easier way to link to a CMS Page.
- **Forum**: Provides an easier way to link to a Forum.
- **Calendar**: Provides an easier way to link to a Calendar.

### Permissions

Menu items are tied into the <Link href="/user-manual/security">ACL permission system</Link>. Allowing you to hide/show menu items based on user roles.
