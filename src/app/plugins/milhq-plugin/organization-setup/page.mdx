# Organization Introduction

Before soldiers can enlist, check their p-files, and mark their attendance for courses, admins need to set up their
organization within the MILHQ Admin Control Panel. (Admin Panel > MILHQ > Configuration)

## Documents

Documents provide admins with the ability to attach a visual formal document to a record.

![Documents](/user-manual/plugins/milhq-plugin/documents.png)

- **Name**: The name of the position.
- **Description**: Brief summary outlining the document, only seen in the admin control panel.
- **Content**: This is what will appear when you open the document in a p-file, you can use placeholders to display soldier data.
- *To see what variables you can use, click on the View possible placeholders in the New Document form.*

## Forms

Forms are a great tool to allow soldiers to submit forms such as Leave of Absence. Learn more about
[Forms](/plugins/milhq-plugin/forms).

## Positions

Positions provide indication of a soldier's position within the unit.

![Positions](/user-manual/plugins/milhq-plugin/positions.png)

- **Name**: The name of the position.
- **Description**: Brief summary outlining the position, only seen in the admin control panel.

## Ranks

Ranks define authority, responsibility, and progression within your unit. At the moment, ranks are structured in a flat
list, meaning there is no categories for them.

![Ranks](/user-manual/plugins/milhq-plugin/ranks.png)

- **Name**: The name of the rank.
- **Description**: Brief summary outlining the role.
- **Abbreviation**: A shortened form used for compact display. (Example: "CPT" for Captain).
- **Paygrade**: The numeric or letter grade indicating the rank's level within the hierarchy.
- **Image**: Visual insignia representing the rank, displayed on p-files and rosters.

## Rosters

Rosters let admins categorise their units.

![Rosters](/user-manual/plugins/milhq-plugin/rosters.png)

- **Description**: Brief summary outlining the roster, only seen in the admin control panel.

## Specialties

Specialties are a way to identify a soldier's specialty. As an example for a US Infantryman, their specialty would be
11B (Their MOS). While for a UK soldier with training as a sharpshooter, might have "Sharpshooter" as their specialty.

![Specialties](/user-manual/plugins/milhq-plugin/specialties.png)

- **Name**: The name of the specialty.
- **Description**: Brief summary outlining the specialty, could include the requirements for it.
- **Abbreviation**: A shortened form used for compact display. (Example: "11B" for Infantryman).

## Statuses

Statuses inform us of a soldier's current standing and availability. For example, if a soldier has the status "LOA" then we
know that they're currently not available to attend missions. Setting up statuses is rather easy,

![Statuses](/user-manual/plugins/milhq-plugin/statuses.png)

- **Name**: The name of the status.
- **Color**: Give the status a color to make it easily identifiable.

## Units

Units provide the core organizational structure within your unit. They determine how and where personnel are grouped for
missions, administration, and support.

![Units](/user-manual/plugins/milhq-plugin/units.png)

- **Name**: The name of the unit.
- **Description**: A description for the unit, this is optional.
- **Supervisors**: You can set the unit's 1IC and 2IC by selecting the positions. If multiple positions selected,
the position's sorting will decide the hierarchy.
- **Mark supervisors on roster**: This will add an adornment on the roster.
