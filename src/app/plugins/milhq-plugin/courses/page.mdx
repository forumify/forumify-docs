# Courses

Courses allow you to create trainings and courses, track attendance of instructors and students, and automatically
create qualification and service records based on their performance. This feature requires MILHQ Premium.

## How to create a new course

Head over to Courses (Admin Panel > MILHQ > Courses) and create a new course.

instructors and trainees, and see relevant information about the class.
