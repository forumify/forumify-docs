# Enlistment

## Enlistment Setup

To set up Enlistments, head over to the Admin Panel > MILHQ > Configuration
![Enlistment Setup](/user-manual/plugins/milhq-plugin/enlistment.png)

On this page you can modify the plugin's behaviour when it comes to enlistments and if it should automatically post the enlistment in a forum
or assign a default role if you want to make your enlistments forum only visible to enlistees and recruiters.

To create an enlistment form, see the [form documentation](/plugins/milhq-plugin/forms).

When a user creates an enlistment, a submission will be made (Admin Panel > MILHQ > Submissions > "Your Enlistment Form Name").
From there the enlistment can be accepted or denied.

## Enlistment Flow
The enlistment flow is a breakdown of the enlistment process for admins to understand.

1) When a forumify user submits an enlistment application through the MILHQ > Enlist menu, a soldier is automatically created.
2) Admins then head to Admin Panel > MILHQ > Submissions and action the application (Accept/Deny).
3) Admins then need to create an assignment record for the new soldier by heading to Admin Panel > MILHQ > Soldiers and clicking on Quick Actions > New Assignment
4) Select the new soldier in the users field and fill out the rest of the fields.
5) Once submitted, the new soldier is officially a member of the unit.

<Alert severity="warning">
    Only forumify users who do not have a soldier or their soldier's status has been selected as an enlistment status are eligible to enlist.
