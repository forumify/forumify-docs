# Calendar

The calendar plugins brings basic event scheduling capabilities to your forumify website.

## Managing calendars

To get started with this plugin, you first need to create one or more calendars in the <Link href="/user-manual/admin-panel">Admin Panel</Link>.
You can find them under <Wrench /> Settings -> <Calendar /> Calendar.

Calendars can be compared to buckets for events. Each calendar has a name, color, and permissions.

### Adding the calendar to your menu

There is no dedicated calendar menu item to add to your <Link href="/user-manual/menu-builder">menu builder</Link>.

The best way to add it to your menu, is using a menu item using the "Route" type and setting the route to `forumify_calendar_all`.
To directly access a specific calendar, you can include its slug in the route parameters:

```json
{
    "slug": "example-calendar"
}
```
*\*The slug is a safe version of the title, you can find it by selecting the calendar in the frontend, and looking at the URL.*


## Managing events

Events are managed entirely from the frontend.

### Creating events

When you have the "Manage Events" permission on at least 1 calendar,
the <span className="btn-link"><Plus /> Create Event</span> button will appear.

The event end time is optional, but when not provided, on the week-view it will use 1 hour by default.

### Managing events

Find the event you'd like to modify in the calendar and open it.
If you have the "Manage Events" permission you will be able to see the edit and delete icons in the top right of the event popup.
