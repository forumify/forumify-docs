# Enlistment Setup

Users that sign up to your website should not need access to PERSCOM.io, so the entire enlistment process is encapsulated within forumify.


To set up Enlistments, head over to the admin control panel > PERSCOM > Configuration
![Enlistment Setup](/user-manual/plugins/perscom-plugin/enlistment.jpg)

On this page you can modify the plugin's behaviour when it comes to enlistments and if it should automatically post the enlistment in a forum
or assign a default role if you want to make your enlistments forum only visible to enlistees and recruiters.

The integration plugin allows you to create the form within the admin control panel, however, in order to add fields,
you'll need to head over to your PERSCOM.io > Forms > Edit "Form Name" and click Add field.
![Enlistment Setup](/user-manual/plugins/perscom-plugin/perscomio_form.jpg)

When a user creates an enlistment, a submission will be made (Admin Panel > PERSCOM > Submissions > "Your Enlistment Form Name").
From there the enlistment can be accepted or denied.

# Enlistment Flow
The enlistment flow is a breakdown of the enlistment process for admins to understand.

1) When a forumify user submits an enlistment application through the PERSCOM > Enlist menu, a PERSCOM user is automatically created.
2) Admins then head to Admin Panel > PERSCOM > Submissions and action the application (Accept/Deny).
3) Admins then need to create an assignment record for the new PERSCOM user by heading to Admin Panel > PERSCOM > Users and clicking on Quick Actions > New Assignment
4) Select the new PERSCOM user in the users field and fill out the rest of the fields.
5) Once submitted, the new PERSCOM user is officially a member of the unit.

<Alert severity="warning">
    Only forumify users who do not have a PERSCOM user or their PERSCOM user's status has been selected as an enlistment status are eligible to enlist.
</Alert>
