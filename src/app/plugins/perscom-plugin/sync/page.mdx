# Sync
To keep data up to date, the perscom integration plugin uses 2 way data synchronization. When you edit an item within the plugin, it will automatically be sent to
PERSCOM.io. All changes from PERSCOM.io are also replicated daily to the plugin.

## Manual Synchronization

If you can not wait until the next automatic sync, you can use the Trigger Manual Sync button in the top right corner of the sync page (Admin Panel > PERSCOM > Sync).
<Alert severity="info">
    Clicking Trigger Manual Sync button will launch a two-step confirmation. You'll be taken to a confirmation screen that'll warn you about the full data sync impact and only after you've
    clicked continue is the sync actually processed. This is an extra step that acts as a failsafe in case the button is pressed accidentally.
</Alert>

You can see the history of both manual and automatic syncs as well as a log for each.
