# Themes

Did you creat a beautiful theme for forumify and want to share or sell it on the marketplace? Then you'll have to create a theme.

Dissection of a theme:
```
my-cool-theme
  /public
  /src/MyCoolTheme.php
  /composer.json
```

## Composer File

Just like plugins, themes are also managed by composer to apply versioning and dependency constraints.

Basic theme composer.json (can be partially generated by running `composer init` in an empty directory):

`/composer.json`
```json
{
    "name": "acme-corporation/cool-theme",
    "type": "forumify-theme",
    "autoload": {
        "psr-4": {
            "AcmeCorporation\\": "src/"
        }
    },
    "extra": {
        "forumify-plugin-class": "AcmeCorporation\\CoolTheme"
    }
}
```

- `name`: The vendor and name for your theme, in the form of `vendor/name`.
- `type`: Always `forumify-theme` for themes.
- `autoload.psr-4`: Root PHP namespace definition, using the PSR-4 standard, this should be your vendor name in UpperCamelCase.
- `extra.forumify-plugin-class`: Themes are an abstraction of a plugin, so we pick the theme configuration class as plugin class.

Version constraints on forumify aren't as necessary on themes as they are on plugins. A lot less can break with a theme.
It is recommended to set at least forumify's major version as a requirement. When forumify updates to a new major, you can always loosen the constraint
then. For example if your theme requires at least version 1 of forumify:

`/composer.json`
```json
{
    // ...
    "requires": {
        "forumify/forumify-platform": "^1.0"
    }
}
```

## Theme Configuration Class

The theme class is used to provide more metadata, declare overridable variables and the location of assets that should be loaded by default.

`/src/CoolTheme.php`
```php
<?php

namespace AcmeCorporation;

use Forumify\Plugin\AbstractForumifyTheme;
use Forumify\Plugin\PluginMetadata;
use Forumify\Plugin\ThemeConfig;
use Forumify\Plugin\ThemeVar;
use Forumify\Plugin\ThemeVarType;

class CoolTheme extends AbstractForumifyTheme
{
    /**
     * Basic information about your theme.
     */
    public function getPluginMetadata(): PluginMetadata
    {
        return new PluginMetadata(
            'My Cool Theme',
            'ACME Corporation',
            'A very stylish theme that allows users to recolor their header.'
        );
    }

    /**
     * An array of stylesheets that have to be loaded on every page.
     * These files must exist in the /public folder.
     */
    public function getStylesheets(): array
    {
        return ['style.css'];
    }

    /**
     * The theme's configuration which will allow users to override theme parameters.
     * You should add as many variables as possible to allow for maximum customization by the user.
     * Keys are injected into the document as CSS variables
     * Value priority is as follows:
     *      In dark mode: User Config > Dark Default > Default
     *      In light mode: User Config > Default
     */
    public function getThemeConfig(): ThemeConfig
    {
        return new ThemeConfig(
            hasDarkVariant: true,
            vars: [
                new ThemeVar(
                    key: 'c-header-color',
                    label: 'Header Color',
                    type: ThemeVarType::Color,
                    defaultValue: 'orange',
                    defaultDarkValue: 'darkorange'
                ),
            ]
        );
    }
}
```

## Static Resources

Static resources such as CSS stylesheets, images, fonts,... should be placed in the **`/public`** directory.
When forumify refreshes your theme, for example during initial installation or when updating, it will copy your public directory
into the user's `/public/themes/<vendor>/<package>` directory.

<Alert severity="info">
    You can also use asset builders to enable sass/scss, the general convention is to place source assets in the `/assets` directory.
    The output of your builder can be set to `/public`. Just be aware that anything outside of the public directory will not be copied into userland!
</Alert>

For example, using the variable we defined in our configuration:

`/public/style.css`
```css
.header {
    background-color: var(--c-header-color);
}
```

## Testing

To test your theme, we'll symlink it into our development instance of forumify. Assuming the following directory structure:
```
/forumify
/cool-theme
```

Modify your instance's (not the theme's!) composer.json:

`/forumify/composer.json`
```json
{
    // ...
    "repositories": [
        {
            "type": "path",
            "url": "../cool-theme"
        }
    ]
}
```

Now install your theme using composer:

`/forumify`
```
$ composer install acme-corporation/cool-theme
```

The theme should automatically be added in your instance's admin panel under Settings -> Themes.
If you've followed the code samples above, and you activate the theme,
you should also be able to change the header menu color straight from the admin panel.

<Alert severity="info">
    Theme discovery happens during the `forumify:plugins:refresh` command that is automatically executed after installing or updating dependencies with composer.
    If it is not automatically added, you can try running the command manually: `php bin/console forumify:plugins:refresh`.
</Alert>
