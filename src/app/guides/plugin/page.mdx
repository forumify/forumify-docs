# Plugins

Plugins are re-usable packages that add functionality to a forumify instance. A plugin should be installable on any forumify instance.
If you'd prefer to create specific functionality only for your forumify instance, you should work in your instance's `src/` folder instead.

## Setup

<Alert severity="info">
    It is recommended to create a local sandbox forumify environment where you can activate your in-dev plugins without causing any issues.
    See the <Link href="/guides/customization/introduction">Customization Introduction Guide</Link> to learn about running a local forumify instance.
</Alert>

forumify plugins are almost identical to Symfony bundles but with some configuration taken care of in an abstraction layer. Let's start by creating an empty directory to work in.

```
$ mkdir todo-plugin; cd todo-plugin
```

Then we'll initialize composer.

```
$ composer init

This command will guide you through creating your composer.json config.
