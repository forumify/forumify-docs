# Entities

Entities are objects whose data is stored in the database. forumify already comes with a plethora of entities, from users to forums, topics, messages, etc.
Anything that needs to be stored in the database will need an entity class.

forumify uses [Doctrine](https://symfony.com/doc/current/doctrine.html) as the abstraction layer between the application and the database.

In our example project, Flex has generated a `src/Entity` directory for us. This is where we'll put all of our entity classes.

<Alert severity="info">
    It is possible to change the default doctrine entity directory, or have multiple directories if you want to split your code.
    You can do so by modifying the `doctrine.orm.mappings` value in `config/packages/doctrine.yaml`.
</Alert>

## Todo Entities

For our TODO app, we want to have todos, and we want the ability to only show some groups of todos to specific users.
So for this we'll create 2 entities. `Todo` and `TodoCategory`.

All entities must also have the doctrine `Entity` attribute.

`src/Entity/Todo.php`
```php
<?php

namespace App\Entity;

use Doctrine\ORM\Mapping as ORM;

#[ORM\Entity]
class Todo
{

}
```

This is where we can start using some of the forumify traits to help us create our entity faster.
For this, we'll use 3 traits.
- `IdentifiableEntityTrait`: Adds an auto-increment `id` field,
- `BlameableEntityTrait`: Adds the `createdBy` and `updatedBy` fields that link the entity to a user,
- `TimestampableEntityTrait`: Adds the `createdAt` and `updatedAt` fields, which are useful to track when the entity got created and last updated.

`src/Entity/Todo.php`
```php
// ...
use Forumify\Core\Entity\BlameableEntityTrait;
use Forumify\Core\Entity\IdentifiableEntityTrait;
use Forumify\Core\Entity\TimestampableEntityTrait;

#[ORM\Entity]
class Todo
{
    use IdentifiableEntityTrait;
    use BlameableEntityTrait;
    use TimestampableEntityTrait;
}
```

To finish off our Todo entity, we'll add one last field. A description of what that needs to be done.
We also need to add a getter and setter to get and update the field later.

`src/Entity/Todo.php`
```php
// ...
class Todo
{
    // ...
    #[ORM\Column]
    private string $description;

    public function getDescription(): string
    {
        return $this->description;
    }

    public function setDescription(string $description): void
    {
        $this->description = $description;
    }
}
```

<Alert severity="info">
    You can also use the [MakerBundle](https://symfony.com/bundles/SymfonyMakerBundle/current/index.html) to automatically generate entity classes.
    We recommend getting used to doing it manually, as it's something that should become second nature and MakerBundle doesn't know about forumify's shortcuts.
</Alert>

Now let's create the `TodoCategory` entity. For this entity, we will only allow admins to create/modify them, so we're not going to include the `Blameable` or `Timestampable` traits.

`src/Entity/TodoCategory.php`
```php
<?php

namespace App\Entity;

use Doctrine\ORM\Mapping as ORM;
use Forumify\Core\Entity\IdentifiableEntityTrait;

#[ORM\Entity]
class TodoCategory
{
    use IdentifiableEntityTrait;

    #[ORM\Column]
    private string $title;

    public function getTitle(): string
    {
        return $this->title;
    }

    public function setTitle(string $title): void
    {
        $this->title = $title;
    }
}
```

## Relationships

You may have noticed that currently there's no link between a Todo and a TodoCategory. So let's create a relationship between the two so that each todo must belong to a category.

In this case we will use a bidirectional many-to-one relationship from Todo to TodoCategory.
- bidirectional: each side of the relationship contains a field to the other entity
- many-to-one: Many Todos have exactly 1 TodoCategory, or the inverse, 1 TodoCategory has zero-or-more Todos.

Many-to-one relationships should always define what we want to happen when the related entity gets removed.
In our case, `TodoCategory` acts like a parent to the `Todo` and it doesn't make sense to have `Todo`s that aren't in any categories,
so if the parent is removed, we want all the children to be removed too. This can be done using the `JoinColumn` annotation.

`src/Entity/Todo.php`
```php
class Todo {
    // the other private fields...

    #[ORM\ManyToOne(targetEntity: TodoCategory::class, inversedBy: 'todos')]
    #[ORM\JoinColumn(onDelete: 'CASCADE')]
    private TodoCategory $category;

    // the existing getters/setters...

    public function getCategory(): TodoCategory
    {
        return $this->category;
    }

    public function setCategory(TodoCategory $category): void
    {
        $this->category = $category;
    }
}
```

And now the inverse side, if `Todo` has a `ManyToOne` to the category, then the category will be a `OneToMany` to todos.
Since the category will hold multiple `Todo`s, doctrine has a special `Collection` type for them. There are some caveats when using collections.

1. They must be initialized in the constructor with an empty `ArrayCollection`,
2. They should be accompanied by a type annotation so your editor can figure out what's inside of it (`/** @var Collection<Type> */`),
3. Symfony sometimes calls the setter with just an array instead of a `Collection`, so if it gets called with an `array`, we must transform it into a `Collection` in the setter.

`src/Entity/TodoCategory.php`
```php
class TodoCategory {
    // the other fields...

    /** @var Collection<Todo> */
    #[ORM\OneToMany(mappedBy: 'category', targetEntity: Todo::class)]
    private Collection $todos;

    public function __construct()
    {
        $this->todos = new ArrayCollection();
    }

    // the existing getters/setters

    /**
     * @return Collection<Todo>
     */
    public function getTodos(): Collection
    {
        return $this->todos;
    }

    /**
     * @param Collection<Todo>|array<Todo> $todos
     */
    public function setTodos(Collection|array $todos): void
    {
        $this->todos = !$todos instanceof Collection
            ? new ArrayCollection($todos)
            : $todos;
    }
}
```

## Database

So, we've now created these entities, but that doesn't automatically update the database. For that, we need database migrations.
Migrations are raw SQL that needs to be executed when you modify your entities. Plugins and forumify itself also have migrations that run
any time they are updated.

Doctrine comes in clutch here as we don't need to write these migrations ourselves. Doctrine can compare your current database schema with all the entities
it is aware of, and generate the SQL code for us. If you take a peek in `config/packages/doctrine_migrations.yaml` you will see that it defines a namespace and directory
for our migrations.

Run the following command with our namespace to generate the migrations:

```
$ symfony console doctrine:migrations:diff --namespace=DoctrineMigrations
```

This will create a file in the configured directory, so if you open the `migrations/` directory, you should see a new PHP file with our migration.
It's a good practice to always give your migration a description. If it happens to error later, it'll be much easier to see what went wrong.

Your migration should look something like this:

`migrations/VersionYYYMMDDHHIISS.php`
```php
final class VersionYYYYMMDDHHIISS extends AbstractMigration
{
    public function getDescription(): string
    {
        return 'add todos';
    }

    public function up(Schema $schema): void
    {
        $this->addSql('CREATE TABLE todo (id INT AUTO_INCREMENT NOT NULL, category_id INT DEFAULT NULL, created_by INT DEFAULT NULL, updated_by INT DEFAULT NULL, description VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, created_at DATETIME DEFAULT NULL, updated_at DATETIME DEFAULT NULL, INDEX IDX_5A0EB6A012469DE2 (category_id), INDEX IDX_5A0EB6A0DE12AB56 (created_by), INDEX IDX_5A0EB6A016FE72E1 (updated_by), PRIMARY KEY(id)) DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE `utf8mb4_unicode_ci` ENGINE = InnoDB');
        $this->addSql('CREATE TABLE todo_category (id INT AUTO_INCREMENT NOT NULL, title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY(id)) DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE `utf8mb4_unicode_ci` ENGINE = InnoDB');
        $this->addSql('ALTER TABLE todo ADD CONSTRAINT FK_5A0EB6A012469DE2 FOREIGN KEY (category_id) REFERENCES todo_category (id) ON DELETE CASCADE');
        $this->addSql('ALTER TABLE todo ADD CONSTRAINT FK_5A0EB6A0DE12AB56 FOREIGN KEY (created_by) REFERENCES user (id) ON DELETE SET NULL');
        $this->addSql('ALTER TABLE todo ADD CONSTRAINT FK_5A0EB6A016FE72E1 FOREIGN KEY (updated_by) REFERENCES user (id) ON DELETE SET NULL');
    }

    public function down(Schema $schema): void
    {
        $this->addSql('ALTER TABLE todo DROP FOREIGN KEY FK_5A0EB6A012469DE2');
        $this->addSql('ALTER TABLE todo DROP FOREIGN KEY FK_5A0EB6A0DE12AB56');
        $this->addSql('ALTER TABLE todo DROP FOREIGN KEY FK_5A0EB6A016FE72E1');
        $this->addSql('DROP TABLE todo');
        $this->addSql('DROP TABLE todo_category');
    }
}
```

<Alert severity="warning">
    It is always a good idea to inspect your migration before blindly executing it. Sometimes doctrine will include changes to entities that aren't yours.
    This can happen when doctrine updates the way entities are mapped to MySQL, but the framework or plugin that the entity belongs to hasn't updated it on their end yet.

    If you notice any SQL statements that are modifying tables that are not part of your application/plugin **you must delete those lines!**
</Alert>

Now we can execute our migrations:
```
$ symfony console doctrine:migrations:migrate
```

If everything went well, you can now visit your database using a MySQL client and you should see 2 new tables, `todo` and `todo_category`.
When using a DBAL/ORM like Doctrine, it's generally not a great idea to look at the database directly, but it can be helpful to identify issues if you know what you're looking for.

## Repositories

Last but not least, we need a way to access and modify our entities from within our application.
For this we'll be using the "Repository Pattern". Repositories act as a barrier between our business logic and our database logic.
If your application needs to perform some complex queries to fetch data, these functions should exist in the repository, and not in the rest of the application.

So let's create 2 repositories, one for each of our entities. Again, forumify gives a helpful abstraction to Doctrine's native repositories.

`src/Repository/TodoRepository`
```php
<?php

namespace App\Repository;

use App\Entity\Todo;
use Forumify\Core\Repository\AbstractRepository;

class TodoRepository extends AbstractRepository
{
    public static function getEntityClass(): string
    {
        return Todo::class;
    }
}
```

`src/Repository/TodoCategoryRepository`
```php
<?php

namespace App\Repository;

use App\Entity\TodoCategory;
use Forumify\Core\Repository\AbstractRepository;

class TodoCategoryRepository extends AbstractRepository
{
    public static function getEntityClass(): string
    {
        return TodoCategory::class;
    }
}
```

In some parts of our application, repositories are dynamically fetched based on the entity. For that reason, it's also recommended
to define your repositories on the entity's `Entity` attribute.

`src/Entity/Todo.php`
```php
#[ORM\Entity(repositoryClass: TodoRepository::class)]
class Todo { /* ... */ }
```

`src/Entity/TodoCategory.php`
```php
#[ORM\Entity(repositoryClass: TodoCategoryRepository::class)]
class TodoCategory { /* ... */ }
```

## Done!

Unfortunately there's not much to see yet. We've just created 2 entities but nowhere to show or manage them...
In the next guide, we'll create 2 admin CRUD (**c**reate, **r**ead, **u**pdate, **d**elete) controllers for these entities, so we can finally see our work.
