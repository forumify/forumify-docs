# Frontend

Up until now we've been helped by forumify's abstractions to do most of the heavy lifting.
For the frontend, we'll need to be a little more creative to create a nice looking page for our todos.

Let's head back to the start. For our frontend we'll also need a controller and some routing.

## Routing/Controller

Just like with the admin controller, we're going to put everything that belongs solely on the frontend in a separate directory.
Let's start by creating the directory `src/Frontend/Controller`.

Now we can modify our `routes.yaml` to register and assign a prefix to all the controllers in our application.

`config/routes.yaml`
```yaml
# ...

app_frontend:
    resource: ../src/Frontend/Controller
    type: attribute
    name_prefix: app_
```

Now all the routes declared by controllers in `src/Frontend/Controller` will get the `app_` prefix, but no path prefix.
Remember from the admin guide, we used the `admin/` path prefix for security reason. On the frontend, we're on our own for security.

This time we'll be extending Symfony's `AbstractController`, and we'll use PHP's magic `__invoke()` function for our controller action.

`src/Frontend/Controller/TodoController.php`
```php
<?php

namespace App\Frontend\Controller;

use Symfony\Bundle\FrameworkBundle\Controller\AbstractController;
use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Response;

class TodoController extends AbstractController
{
    public function __invoke()
    {
    }
}
```

Now we'll assign it a route, and we'll just have it return a simple message:

`src/Frontend/Controller/TodoController.php`
```php
class TodoController extends AbstractController
{
    #[Route('todos', 'todos')]
    public function __invoke(): Response
    {
        return new Response('hello from frontend!');
    }
}
```

Once that's set up, if we navigate to `/todos`, you should simply see a very unappealing "hello from frontend!" message.

## Templates

Let's bring in some templating so we can have the forumify layout applied to our controller.

We'll create a template in `templates/frontend` that extends the base forumify template and shows our message.
It's a good practice to nest your templates, so it's easy to refactor them later on.

`templates/frontend/todos/todos.html.twig`
```twig
{% extends '@Forumify/frontend/base.html.twig' %}
{% block title_page %}Todos{% endblock %}
{% block body %}
    <h1>Todos</h1>
    <p>Hello from frontend!</p>
{% endblock %}
```

And we also need to change our controller to render this template instead of our silly response.

`src/Frontend/Controller/TodoController.php`
```php
class TodoController extends AbstractController
{
    #[Route('todos', 'todos')]
    public function __invoke(): Response
    {
        return $this->render('frontend/todos/todos.html.twig');
    }
}
```

This doesn't really do much though. It's just a static page. We need to bring in our categories so we can display them.
For that we'll be using the `TodoCategoryRepository`, and we'll use the tabs component to show a tab for every category.

Let's start by feeding our template all of our categories.

`src/Frontend/Controller/TodoController.php`
```php
class TodoController extends AbstractController
{
    public function __construct(private readonly TodoCategoryRepository $todoCategoryRepository)
    {
    }

    #[Route('todos', 'todos')]
    public function __invoke(): Response
    {
        return $this->render('frontend/todos/todos.html.twig', [
            'categories' => $this->todoCategoryRepository->findAll(),
        ]);
    }
}
````

Now all the categories are available in a `categories` Twig variable, so we can iterate over them and display a tab for each category.

`templates/frontend/todos/todos.html.twig`
```twig
{% extends '@Forumify/frontend/base.html.twig' %}
{% block title_page %}Todos{% endblock %}
{% block body %}
    <h1>Todos</h1>
    {% embed '@Forumify/components/tabs.html.twig' %}
        {% block tabs %}
            {% for category in categories %}
                <button
                    class="btn-link"
                    type="button"
                    data-tab-id="category-{{ category.id }}"
                >
                    {{ category.title }}
                </button>
            {% endfor %}
        {% endblock %}
        {% block tabpanels %}
            {% for category in categories %}
                <div id="category-{{ category.id }}">
                    <h2>{{ category.title }}</h2>
                </div>
            {% endfor %}
        {% endblock %}
    {% endembed %}
{% endblock %}
```

As you can see, now all categories have their own tab. And switching between the tabs just displays the title of the category.
For the todos, let's use a LiveComponent, so we can create and check off todos using AJAX.

## TodoList LiveComponent

LiveComponent allows us to make interactive user experiences without having to write a single line of JavaScript.
This is extremely powerful. Having to re-render the entire page just for small changes causes a lot of overhead.
Instead, with LiveComponents we can only re-render a small portion of the page,
which results in better performance and a smoother experience for the user.

Always consider using LiveComponents when you're dealing with small components that do not affect a large state of the application.
Some examples where LiveComponents are used in forumify: tables, lists, messenger, notifications, etc...

Let's create a new class in `src/Frontend/Component` named `TodoList` and apply the `AsLiveComponent` attribute.

`src/Frontend/Component/TodoList.php`
```php
<?php

namespace App\Frontend\Component;

use Symfony\UX\LiveComponent\Attribute\AsLiveComponent;
use Symfony\UX\LiveComponent\DefaultActionTrait;

#[AsLiveComponent('App\TodoList', 'frontend/todos/todo_list.html.twig')]
class TodoList
{
    use DefaultActionTrait;
}
```

Remember to always prefix your LiveComponents, and we specified a template here but it doesn't exist yet.
Additionally you can see we use the `DefaultActionTrait` trait. This is just a helper from Symfony if your component doesn't have a default action.

Let's create that template too:

`templates/frontend/todos/todo_list.html.twig`
```twig
<div {{ attributes }}>
    <div data-loading>
        {% include '@Forumify/components/loader.html.twig' %}
    </div>
    <div data-loading="hide>
        <p>Nobody here but us chickens!</p>
    </div>
</div>
```

We bootstrapped it with a couple of things. `{{ attributes }}` on the first element is required by LiveComponent.
This is where it will mount a Stimulus JavaScript controller that allows us to do all of this without writing any ourselves.
Additionally, we also added a div with `data-loading`. This is what will be shown if our component is waiting on the server to process our AJAX requests.

The rest will go in the `data-loading="hide"` div, as this content should be hidden when a request is already pending.

Now let's insert our component in `todos.html.twig`.

`templates/frontend/todos/todos.html.twig`
```twig
{% block tabpanels %}
    {% for category in categories %}
        <div id="category-{{ category.id }}">
            <h2>{{ category.title }}</h2>
            {{ component('App\\TodoList') }}
        </div>
    {% endfor %}
{% endblock %}
```

When we refresh the page, we should see the message "Nobody here but us chickens!"

Let's pass in the category from our main template, into our LiveComponent. To do this, we need to add a `LiveProp` on our component, and pass it
as an argument from our template.

`src/Frontend/Components/TodoList.php`
```php
#[AsLiveComponent('App\TodoList', 'frontend/todos/todo_list.html.twig')]
class TodoList
{
    use DefaultActionTrait;

    #[LiveProp]
    public TodoCategory $category;
}
```

`templates/frontend/todos/todo.html.twig`
```twig
{{ component('App\\TodoList', { category: category }) }}
```

And let's display all the todos in our component.

`templates/frontend/todos/todo_list.html.twig`
```twig
<div data-loading="hide">
    <ul>
        {% for todo in category.todos %}
            <li>{{ todo.description }}</li>
        {% else %}
            <li>Nothing to do!</li>
        {% endfor %}
    </ul>
</div>
```

Let's also add an input to submit a new todo.

`templates/frontend/todos/todo_list.html.twig`
```twig
<ul>
    {% for todo in category.todos %}
        <li>{{ todo.description }}</li>
    {% else %}
        <li>Nothing to do!</li>
    {% endfor %}
    <li class="mt-6 flex items-end">
        <div>
            <label for="new-todo-description">New Todo</label>
            <input id="new-todo-description" type="text" data-model="norender|newTodoDescription">
        </div>
        <button
            class="btn-primary btn-icon"
            data-action="live#action"
            data-live-action-param="saveNewTodo"
        >
            <i class="ph ph-plus"></i>
        </button>
    </li>
</ul>
```

Okay, a lot to unpack here. We added a list item with an input and a button.

The input has an attribute `data-model` that links this input with a field in our LiveComponent. We'll look at that in a second.
In addition to this linkage, we also add the `norender` function. This prevents the component from sending data to the server
every time the input changes, and instead sends the changed field along with the next action that happens.

Then the button has a `data-action` attribute with a special value, `live#action`, this means on the default action for buttons,
which is click, it will call a live action in the component. Which action? Well that's defined in the `data-live-action-param`.
In this case, when the button is clicked, execute the live action with name `saveNewTodo`.

Now let's look at what we have to do in the component to make all of this work:

`src/Frontend/Component/TodoList.php`
```php
class TodoList
{
    // ...

    #[LiveProp(writable: true)]
    public string $newTodoDescription = '';

    public function __construct(private readonly TodoRepository $todoRepository)
    {
    }

    #[LiveAction]
    public function saveNewTodo(): void
    {
        if (empty($this->newTodoDescription)) {
            return;
        }

        $todo = new Todo();
        $todo->setCategory($this->category);
        $todo->setDescription($this->newTodoDescription);
        $this->todoRepository->save($todo);

        $this->newTodoDescription = '';
    }
}
```

Okay, so that's not too bad. First we add another `LiveProp`, but this time we make it write-able. This is the property that our input is linked to.
We inject our `TodoRepository` in the constructor because we're going to be saving some Todos.

Then we define that `LiveAction`, which is just a PHP function with the `LiveAction` attribute. Nothing fancy here.
When the button is clicked, we check if we've received a new description, and if we did, we'll create a new todo, save it and clear the input's value.

Let's try it out. Try creating some new todos. And you'll see that you can now create todos.
The loader pops up briefly, and the todo list is updated without re-rendering the entire page.

And all of this without a single line of JavaScript. Neat right?

Alright, let's finish this component off with a button in front of each todo, and when it's clicked, we remove the todo.

`templates/frontend/todos/todo_list.html.twig`
```twig
{% for todo in category.todos %}
    <li>
        <button
            class="btn-link btn-small btn-icon"
            data-action="live#action"
            data-live-action-param="completeTodo"
            data-live-todo-id-param="{{ todo.id }}"
        >
            <i class="ph ph-check"></i>
        </button>
        {{ todo.description }}
    </li>
{% else %}
    <li>Nothing to do!</li>
{% endfor %}
```

Once again, we add a button with the `data-action` argument set to `live#action`, we defined the action in `data-live-action-param`,
and in this case, we also supply the id of the todo we want to complete in `data-live-todo-id-param`.

Let's add this action to our component.

`src/Frontend/Components/TodoList.php`
```php
class TodoList {
    // ...

    #[LiveAction]
    public function completeTodo(#[LiveArg] int $todoId): void
    {
        $todo = $this->todoRepository->find($todoId);
        if ($todo === null) {
            return;
        }

        $this->todoRepository->remove($todo);
    }
}
```

First we fetch the todo using our repository, and if one was found, we delete it.

## Conclusion

And there you have it. We now have a functional todo app. We're going to round off this introduction to customizing the platform
by adding some security elements to our categories and our frontend in general in the next and final guide.
